1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.

-I have learned some new HTML/CSS syntaxes.
-I got hints on styling with JavaScript itself, rather than passing classes for CSS.
-I got better understanding of different units of sizing, like px, rem, vh, etc.

2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?

-A major tweak was ensuring the vertical centering. Copilot did suggest general centering, but I had to guide it to use display: flex, flex-direction: column, and justify-content: center on the parent to achieve the exact look I was aiming for. 
-Another tweak was ensuring the random color generation in JavaScript. It used document.body, like changing the color of the whole body at once. But I specifically targeted the two column classes.

3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?

-Using Copilot to generate code is like asking someone to do your homework, you get the answer quickly, but you don't understand the steps, and when it breaks, you're stuck, like we saw in our last class. 
-Using it as an effective learning partner is a good practice. You give it a small, specific task, and you look at its suggested CSS. You then learn that property and apply it yourself. The key difference is intention: are you trying to finish a task, or are you trying to understand the solution?

4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.

-One major risk is if AI always writes the basic structure, you might panic during an interview when you have to write it from scratch. 
-Second is learning the baiscs. AI can write a complex code and you may think you know an advanced concept, but you lack the fundamental problem-solving steps.
-Third, when the AI-generated code has a bug, a developer who relies too much on AI won't know where to start looking, since they didn't write or fully review the logic themselves.
