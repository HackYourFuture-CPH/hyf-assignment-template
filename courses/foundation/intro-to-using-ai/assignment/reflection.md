I have learned that AI (Copilot) can be a good assistant who can give you hints and make you learn how to use syntaxes to get the UI you desire. 

However it is common for AI to make mistakes, as it not always understands what you want. So, it is vital that you have good knowledge of the fundamentals, and it is always advisable to review AI's answer before you go forward with it.

You always need a human to understand the User Interface/Experience. AI is a very helpful tool, but it can not replace developers, at least not in near future.

A major tweak was ensuring the vertical centering in the right column was correct. Copilot did suggest general centering, but I had to guide it to use display: flex, flex-direction: column, and justify-content: center on the parent to achieve the exact look I was aiming for. 

Another tweak was ensuring the random color generation in JavaScript. It used document.body, like changing the color of the whole body at once. But I specifically targeted the two column classes.

Using Copilot to generate code is like asking someone to do your homework, you get the answer quickly, but you don't understand the steps. You copy, paste, and when it breaks, you're stuck, like we saw in our last class. 

Using it as an effective learning partner is a good practice. You give it a small, specific task, and you look at its suggested CSS. You then learn that property and apply it yourself. The key difference is intention: are you trying to finish a task, or are you trying to understand the solution?

One major risk is failing to build muscle memory with basic syntax. If AI always writes the basic structure, you might panic during an interview when you have to write it from scratch. 

Second is learning the fundamentals. AI can write a complex code and you may think you understand an advanced concept, but you lack the fundamental problem-solving steps.

Third, there's the risk of losing debugging skills. When the AI-generated code has a bug, a developer who relies too much on AI won't know where to start looking, since they didn't write or fully review the logic themselves.
