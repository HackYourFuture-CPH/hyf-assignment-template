1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.

-I learned about use cases of some syntaxes in HTML and CSS.
-I got a good knowledge of size units, e.g. px, rem, vh, etc.
-I got a good overview of styling in JS, rather than CSS.

2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?

-I had to be very precise with CSS classes and colors, as AI sometimes missed those instructions. The main fix was guiding it to use the correct Flexbox properties for the precise vertical centering I wanted in the right column. I had to tweak the whole JavaScript, as AI was giving me too much unnecessary code.

3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?

-Generating code is like asking for answer to homework, which skips the learning part, when the code breaks you're stuck. 

Using it as a learning partner means asking for small hints to understand a specific syntax or property, then applying and learning it yourself.

4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.

-Three risks are: failing to build muscle memory with basic syntax, developing a false sense of knowledge by not understanding the full context of the code, and losing crucial debugging skills when the generated code has an error.
