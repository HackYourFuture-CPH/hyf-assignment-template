1 Three things i've learned and had a better understanding while using AI:
->> How to use hover effects and transitions to make my page more interactive and engaging for users.
->> Applying consistent card styles (like box-shadow,border-radius and background color)
->> Adding media queries to help make my page responsive, so it will be applicable on different devices and screen sizes.

2 I've corrected some of Copilot's suggestions to suit my need:
->> I wanted my experience cards to have the same color and size as my skill and education cards, so i adjusted a matching styles for consistency.
->> I cleaned up some of the HTML so everything looked neat and worked the way i wanted.
->> The About me section's hover effect wasn't visible,so i changed it to more noticeable background color change instead of just a box-shadow.

3 Using Copilot to generate code means letting it do the work for you it writes code automatically, allowing you to complete more quickly. But when you use Copilot as a learning partner,you take an active role in the process , you read its recommendations, enquire about the reasoning behind its writing and apply it to gain a deeper understanding of coding principles.

4 Risks of relying too much on AI tools:
->> It limits creativity and the ability of problem solving.
->> It creates dependency
->> Lack of foundational understanding
