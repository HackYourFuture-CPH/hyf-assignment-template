ten 5 inch skewers
2 lbs chicken breasts, frozen and cut into thin slices using a knife while frozen
For the marinade:
¼ cup mayonnaise
2 tbsp olive oil
4 garlic cloves pressed
1 lemon zested
2 tsp kosher salt
½ tsp ground pepper
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp smoked paprika
2 tsp honey granules

For the garlic parmesan melted butter:
1 stick ½ cup unsalted butter
6 garlic cloves pressed
3 tbsp fresh minced parsley
1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese

Instructions
 
1.Marinate the chicken: Add all of the chicken marinade ingredients to a medium bowl and whisk together to combine. Add all of the frozen, knife sliced chicken breast pieces to the marinade, toss to fully coat and let sit for 15-30 minutes or until the chicken has thawed.

2.Thread the marinated chicken onto the skewers, dividing evenly between the skewers.

3.Heat the grill to medium-high heat, about 400F.

4.Oil the grill well and when heated, place the skewers on the grill and cook, turning occasionally, for about 10-12 minutes or until cooked through (internal temperature reached 165F) and well browned.

5.Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes.

6.While the chicken rests, melt the butter with the 6 cloves pressed garlic for the garlic parmesan sauce in a saucepan on the oven. Once melted, remove from the heat and pour into a bowl.

7.Whisk the minced parsley and freshly grated parmesan cheese into the bowl of melted butter and set aside a bit of the butter mixture for dipping. Immediately brush all the skewers with the remaining garlic parmesan butter and then serve.
