The components of the Architecture

Storage Components

•	Relational Database (SQL / MySQL / similar)

o	Stores all structured recipe information:

	Recipe ID (unique identifier)
	Title
	Ingredients
	Instructions
	Category
	Created By (links recipe to the user)

o	Also holds Users (login credentials, profile info) and Favourites (links between users and recipes).

•	Cloud Storage (Azure Blob/Google Cloud Storage)

o	Stores recipe images or attachments (eg. photos of dishes).
o	The database keeps the URL reference to the image stored in cloud storage.

Communication Flow

•	The frontend (web or mobile app) talks to the backend using HTTP/HTTPS requests. The backend exposes endpoints as either:
o	REST API (eg, GET /recipes, POST /recipes, PUT /recipes/{id})
o	or Graph QL API (queries and mutations for flexible data fetching).

•	Authentication: Each request includes an authentication token. The backbend’s Authentication Service validates the 
        token before allowing access.
•	Frontend → Backend: Sends JSON payloads with recipe data, user actions, or filters.
•	Backend → Frontend: Responds with JSON containing recipe details, user info, or confirmation messages.
•	Routing: Requests first hit the API Gateway (or backend router). The gateway forwards them to the correct
        microservice:

o	Recipe Service (CRUD)
o	Favourites Service
o	Search Service
o	Notification Service
when a user adds a new recipe

•	User fills recipe form in the frontend.
•	Frontend sends POST /recipes with recipe data → Backend API Gateway.
•	Backend validates token → passes to Recipe Service.
•	Recipe Service saves data in Database and image in Cloud Storage.
•	Backend responds with success → Frontend updates UI.
