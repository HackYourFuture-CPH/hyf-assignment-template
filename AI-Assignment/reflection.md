1.	Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.
As a beginner, I've picked up several valuable skills while developing my portfolio. Here are three key things I’ve learned:
•	Building a responsive web page from scratch, including structuring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
•	Deploying a website using GitHub Pages by pushing my code to a GitHub repository
•	Resolving path issues and understanding how Git tracks files
2.	Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?
From vs code GitHub copilot 
3.	How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
Copilot facilitated the efficient development of a responsive portfolio page by generating essential HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. It also provided CSS for styles, layout, and media queries, as well as JavaScript to enhance interactivity. As a learning partner, Copilot contributed to my understanding of the underlying concepts by prompting insightful questions whenever I encountered challenges throughout the process.
4.	Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
Although AI tools can be beneficial, relying on them to address time-sensitive challenges presents considerable risks to my learning process at HYF. For example:
1.	I may diminish my ability to tackle complex problems independently.
2.	I could become overly dependent on AI solutions.
3.	I might struggle to write code without assistance.
