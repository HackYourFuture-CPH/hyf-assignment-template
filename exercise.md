My Experience Using GitHub Copilot


For this project, I created a simple web page called "Dog of the Day" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
GitHub Copilot helped me throughout the process by providing suggestions, explanations, and step-by-step guidance.

I have asked like guide me step by step and explain line by line.
It guided me step by step to build javascript code. Helped me understand why each line of code was used by giving line-by-line explanations.
Suggested how to add interactivity — such as showing and hiding a form when clicking “Add new dog”.
Helped me improve the layout and styling, especially for aligning images and centering buttons.
Made the process easier and faster by providing code examples that I could test and learn from.

What I Learned
How to use JavaScript event listeners to show and hide HTML elements.
How to dynamically add new elements to the DOM using JavaScript.
How to use CSS Flexbox to align and center elements.
The importance of using IDs and classes correctly for styling and scripting.
How small styling adjustments can make a page look more polished and professional.

My Reflection
Working with GitHub Copilot felt like having a coding mentor beside me.  
It didn’t just write code — it explained the logic clearly and helped me understand each concept step by step.  
This improved my confidence in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I have added three types of javascript functionality here:
When I refresh the page the dog name displays randomly at the top below the Dog of the day title.
When I click on the input button the page color changes for every click.
When I click on the Add new dog it displays the form to add dog name and url when i click again the form hide. And by default the form is hidden.
