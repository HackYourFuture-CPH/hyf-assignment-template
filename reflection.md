Q2.Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?
In need to change according my own style and website design or structure but it gives me overall idea that what fuctions I need to add to edit changes or create section, class or button etc

Q3.How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
Obviously it made life easy for us as a developer but we need to check again code to personalize changes. My perspective is to use it as step by step guide or explanation as learning partner. Understanding of concepts are becoming more easy with copilot.

Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
Main risk can be using less brain and more rely on AI creation of codes and this way we cannot understand the concept
AI can stop us from learning how to debug or think through logic errors on our own.
Learning can be slow if we are totally dependent on AI and cannot understand the logic behind codes.
