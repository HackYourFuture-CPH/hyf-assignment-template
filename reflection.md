1. Three new things I learned from AI

I learned how to use JavaScript to change the background color.
I also learned about this cool CSS trick that was new to me:

-webkit-background-clip: text;
-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;


Another thing I learned is that when random background colors are too dark, it can make the text and elements hard to see. I had a complicated solution in mind, but Copilot taught me an easier way — to keep the text and other elements inside light-colored boxes and only change the background color of the body.



2. Where I had to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions

Copilot suggested a different hover effect for the buttons, but I liked my own hover style better, so I kept it.
In general, I wrote most of the code myself first, and only used Copilot when I got stuck — for example, in the parts I mentioned in question one.



3. The difference between using Copilot as a code generator vs. a learning partner

If we use Copilot just as a code generator, we won’t really understand the code.
But if we try to write the code ourselves first and then use Copilot as a learning partner, we can understand its suggestions better. We can also have a real interaction — explain what we need, ask for more details, or request different solutions.
Honestly, working with AI this way is much more fun!



4. Three risks of relying too much on AI tools at HackYourFuture

We might not learn anything on our own.

Our creativity might stop growing.

We might depend too much on AI and lose confidence in our own problem-solving skills.
