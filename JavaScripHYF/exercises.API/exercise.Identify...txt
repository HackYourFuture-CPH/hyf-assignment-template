Data storage:
Recipes are stored in a database (e.g. SQL or NoSQL) managed by the backend. Database has Recipes table which stores many recipes. Each recipe has fields like id, title, ingredients, instructions, etc.

Frontend–backend communication:
The frontend communicates with the backend via REST API using HTTP requests, for example:
* GET /recipes – get all recipes
* GET /recipes/:id – get one recipe
* POST /recipes – create a recipe
* PUT /recipes/:id – update a recipe
* DELETE /recipes/:id – delete a recipe

When a user adds a new recipe:
1. User fills and submits a form in the frontend.
2. Frontend sends a POST /recipes request with recipe data in JSON.
3. Backend validates and saves the recipe in the database, then returns the created recipe  (with id).
4. Frontend updates the UI (e.g. adds the new recipe to the list or redirects to its detail view).
